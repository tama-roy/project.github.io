                        Born in 1981, Mahendra Singh Dhoni belonged to a simple family.
                        His ambition to become a noted sportsperson made him one of the best
                        Indian captains in cricketing history. In this short essay on MS Dhoni
                        in English, we will read about his achievements. He previously excelled
                        in football and badminton. Later, he developed cricketing skills when
                        his football coach sent him to a local cricket club. He became a
                        full-time wicketkeeper of that team. He started focusing on cricket
                        after Class 10. Since then, his career never looked backwards. His
                        positivity won people’s hearts in every phase. After witnessing
                        his remarkable performance at the Ranji level, he was introduced
                        to the Indian team. Seeing his cool captaincy skills for the T20
                        World Championship in 2007 held in South Africa, he was awarded
                        the captain’s position for the one-day international team as well.
                        Within 4 years, he brought the World Cup back to India after 28
                        years in 2011. Since then, he has won a lot of accolades across
                        the world. He received Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 2007-08. He
                        also received LG’s People’s Choice Award in 2013. Under his
                        formidable captaincy, the attitude of the entire cricket team
                        transformed. He is considered to be one of the greatest cricket
                        captains of all time in the world.

                        Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988) is an Indian cricketer who
                        currently captains the India national team. Virat Kohli started
                        his international cricket career in 2008, and the ten years he
                        has played has ensured that every cricket fan will become a Virat
                        Kohli fan. He has played 71 Tests, 211 ODIs and 62 T20Is in 10
                        Tests. He has recorded many records in ten years and here are some
                        of his records - he is the fastest Indian to reach 1,000, 5000,
                        6000 and 7000 runs in Odis and the fastest ODI in the world to
                        score 8000 and 9 000 runs. To make 35 centuries in ODIs, he has 30
                        centuries in ODIs and the fastest in the world to score the fastest.
                        He is the fastest to make 15000 international runs, and he is the
                        only cricketer in the world to have 50+ averages in all three formats
                        of cricket. He is the fastest player to score 17,000 runs in at least
                        innings. He has a record of making the highest run in Indian cricket
                        as an Indian cricketer in the seven calendar years, and three calendar
                        years are also under trial. And he has scored maximum runs in the world
                        in Odis in two calendar years. He is a fitness icon for the youth, and
                        we all know how massive Virat Kohli was in the beginning. But later, he
                        worked very well on his fitness and got fitness, by which he is called
                        India's greatest cricketer.

                    On 25 June 1983, India lifted its first-ever
                    Cricket World Cup title under the captaincy
                    of Kapil Dev. India defeated West Indies in the
                    final match by 43 runs at the Lord's Cricket Ground.
                    Kapil Dev is the greatest all-rounder India
                    has ever produced. He is the only cricketer
                    in the world to have scored all-rounder's double
                    of 4,000 Test runs and 400 Test wickets in Test
                    (international match) cricket.
                    In 1994, he broke the record held by Sir Richard Hadlee,
                    becoming the highest Test wicket-taker in the world. Later in 1999,
                    Courtney Walsh broke Kapil Dev's record. The only player in the
                    world to have achieved all-rounder's double
                    of 4,000 Test runs and 400 Test wickets.
                    Most innings in a career-- 184 Not Out.In the arena of sport,there
                    are heroes and there are winners,
                    but a combination of both a heroic winner is a rare phenomenon.
                    In Indian cricket there is no better
                    example of this breed than Kapil Dev. The cricketer of the century Award
                    decisively mirrors in Kapil Dev,
                    the strength of character, the spirit of overcoming odds,
                    and the mental strength to face adversities and will to overcome
                    even hostile situations. We join the millions in felicitating Kapil Dev
                    for great honour.

                    Sourav Ganguly (48) was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata),
                    India to Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly.
                    His father was among the richest men in the city
                    and ran a flourishing print business.
                    After a prolonged illness, his father died on
                    21 February 2013 at the age of 73.
                    Sourav Ganguly initially played football
                    as it is the favourite sport for the people
                    of Kolkata but was later attracted to Cricket.
                    However, his mother was not very supportive of him
                    taking up any sports as a career.
                    Sourav Ganguly's elder brother Snehasish Ganguly,
                    who was already an established cricketer by then,
                    supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and persuaded
                    their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching
                    camp during his summer holidays.
                    In 1989, Sourav Ganguly was selected to play for the Bengal team.
                    Coincidentally, his brother dropped from the side that year.
                    After an impressive show in the Ranji Trophy
                    in the 1990-91 season, the left-hander came into the limelight.
